# Pure React Playground

Welcome to the Pure React Playground! This repository contains a single HTML file that demonstrates how to use pure React without any build tools or JSX syntax. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple playground for understanding the basics of React by writing React components directly in the DOM using plain JavaScript.

## Description

In this project, you'll find a single HTML file that contains a React component written directly in the DOM using plain JavaScript. The file demonstrates how to create React components, manage state, handle events, and interact with the virtual DOM without the need for build tools or JSX syntax. By studying this file, you'll gain a better understanding of React's core principles and how to use React in a pure form.

## Features

- **Single HTML File**: Explore a single HTML file containing a React component written in pure JavaScript without any build tools or JSX syntax.
- **Plain JavaScript**: Learn how to use plain JavaScript to create React components, manage state, and handle events directly in the DOM.
- **Interactive Playground**: Experiment with the React code directly in the HTML file, modify the component, and observe how changes affect the rendered output.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pure-react.git
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**: Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to start exploring the React component written in pure JavaScript.

3. **Experiment and Learn**: Study the code in the HTML file, modify the React component, and observe how your changes affect the rendered output in the browser.

## Contribution

This repository is for personal learning and practice purposes. Contributions and feedback are not expected, but if you have any ideas for improving the React component or adding new features, feel free to share them.
